        <item>Paradise Falls, near Whitfield, cascade an uninterrupted 31 metres and are most spectacular in spring, early summer or after rain. The walk to the viewing platform is a well‐made stepped track perfect for all ability levels.</item>
        <item>This challenging but rewarding walk begins in Davons Flat and finishes at Eight Mile Gap. Along the way you will encounter spectacular vistas of Mt Buller, The Bluff and Mt McDonald. For a shorter walk to Eagles peaks, start at 8 Mile Gap.</item>
        <item>One of the highest and most recognisable peaks in the area, The Bluff offers breathtaking views from the top. This challenging steep walk through the crags starts at The Bluff Carpark, near Refrigerator Gap. Alternatively, visitors can reach The Bluff from The Bluff Hut. This option is longer, approximately.</item>
        <item>This gentle and pleasant walk follows the Howqua High Track along the Howqua River. The track begins at Eight Mile Flat, which is only accessible to four‐wheel drive vehicles. Those with two‐wheel drive cars can park at Seven Mile Camping Area and walk from there.</item>
        <item>Mt Cobbler is an exposed, rocky alpine summit, so be prepared for the onset of cold, wet and windy conditions at any time of the year. From the camping area at Lake Cobbler, the track enters the forest and dips into a creek gully, before starting the steady climb to an open snow plain. At the intersection turn right (north) to Mt Cobbler peak. The other walking track returns to a 4WD track across the Cobbler Plateau. The walk to the summit is well worthwhile for both the views and wildflowers you will encounter along the way.</item>

        <item>The Bryce Gorge Circuit hike starts at the carpark on the Howitt Road, 23.5km north of Arbuckle Junction (46.5 km north of Licola via Tamboritha Road). From the carpark follow the well defined track across open snow plains for about 1.7km to the waterfall on Pieman Creek. The best view is from a lookout about 50 metres beyond the sign.</item>
        <item>Upper Pioneer Trail in Pioneer Mine Historic Area passes through a magnificent stand of Brittle Gum and offers excellent views of the Pioneer Mine and the Mitta Valley. Keep an eye out for the myriad of water races that supplied water to the mining operations. Please stay well away from the steep edge of the Pioneer Mine. A moderately steep descent takes you back to the Omeo Highway 1km south of the hamlet.</item>
        <item>This track starts at Mount Wills Carpark, just off Omeo Highway. It is a challenging climb but the views are well worth it. The rocky granite summit offers stunning alpine scenery among Snow Gums and fragrant herb fields.</item>
        <item>This historic bridle trail stretches along the Murray River from Tom Groggin to Bunroy Station. The walk is steep and challenging at times but rewards with spectacular views of the Main Range and the Murray River Valley. This trail is also  popular with horse riders.</item>
        <item>This self-guided walk begins at the Dharnya carpark and will introduce you to some of the natural and cultural features of the Barmah forest. The walk includes evidence of Aboriginal and European occupation, the Barmah muster yards and aspects of park management, forestry operations and water regulation.</item>
        <item>Begin this circular walk at the Dharnya carpark or join at the the Barmah Lakes campground, day visitor area or Rices Bridge. The walk passes through mature and regrowth River Red Gum trees past a number of Aboriginal oven (cooking) mounds. It skirts the edge  of Barmah Lake, eventually reaching the Murray River and Broken Creek.</item>
        <item>This circular walk begins behind the Visitor Centre and skirts Dharnya swamp, a low area subject to seasonal flooding. Walk through River Red Gum and Grey Box woodland to Broken Creek. Continue downstream along Broken Creek where you can see pelicans, ducks, egrets and darters. There are a number of Aboriginal oven (cooking) mounds on the way to Rices Weir. See the fish ladder that allows fish to go back upstream past the weir. Return via Sandridge Track or continue on the Lakes Loop track to Dharnya.</item>
        <item>Starting at the Mount Erica carpark, the Beech Gully Nature Walk provides an excellent introduction to the plants and wildlife of the Mountain Ash forests and cool temperate rainforests of the southern slopes of the Baw Baws.</item>
        <item>Short walks or longer hikes are some of the best ways to explore the park. Walkers and hikers should be aware that the weather can deteriorate suddenly and without warning. Don---t hesitate to turn back if the trip becomes too difficult or the weather deteriorates. Be sure to wear strong footwear, pack a snack, carry drinking water and a jacket.</item>
        <item>Commencing at the Mount Erica carpark, this popular walk along a section of the Australian Alps Walking Track leads to a maze of giant granite tors – a great site for rock climbing and abseiling.</item>
        <item>This walk links the Bluff Creek visitor area with Bluff Falls and can be walked in either direction. For much of its route the track follows closely beside Bluff Creek through moist, ferny gullies and tall stands of blue gum trees. Interpretative panels along the way provide information on features of interest.</item>
        <item>This track departs from the Bluff Falls carpark and initially climbs up to the smaller Top Falls where Bluff Creek cascades into a narrow, wet gully. The track rises again to Campbells Lookout, a rocky escarpment that overlooks the steep cliffs and scree-covered slopes of Cudgewa Bluff. The turnoff to Ross Lookout is signposted and the track continues on up a broad ridge through wild cherry trees and black cypress pines.</item>
        <item>This walking track departs from Hinces Creek campsite and initially follows a 4WD track to Hinces Clearing.
